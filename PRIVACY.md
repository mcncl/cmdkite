# Privacy Policy for CMDKite

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the CMDKite Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and shares information.

## Information Collection

### Information Collected Automatically

CMDKite does not collect any personal information or browsing data. The extension:
- Does not track your browsing history
- Does not monitor activity outside of Buildkite domains
- Does not transmit any data to external servers

### Local Storage

CMDKite stores the following information locally on your device:
1. **Recently visited pipelines**: Helps you quickly access pipelines you've recently used
2. **Favorite pipelines**: Pipelines you've marked as favorites
3. **User preferences**: Your settings like theme choice and trigger key

This data never leaves your browser and is only used to provide the extension's functionality.

## Data Usage

### How We Use Information

The locally stored information is used solely to:
- Show your recently visited pipelines
- Display your favorite pipelines
- Apply your chosen preferences

### Third-Party Access

No data is shared with:
- The extension developers
- Buildkite
- Any third parties

## Permissions

### Chrome Permissions Explained

CMDKite requires the following permissions:

1. **storage**: Enables saving your preferences and pipeline history locally
2. **commands**: Required for keyboard shortcut functionality
3. **scripting**: Allows the extension to inject the command palette UI
4. **activeTab**: Enables the extension to interact with the current Buildkite tab

These permissions are used only on Buildkite domains as specified in the extension's manifest.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally in your browser and never transmitted:
- Your information is as secure as your browser and local device
- No risk of data interception during transmission
- No server-side security concerns

## Your Rights

You can:
- Clear all stored data by removing the extension
- Manage favorite pipelines through the extension options
- Control which data is stored by adjusting extension settings

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the date at the top of this policy.
